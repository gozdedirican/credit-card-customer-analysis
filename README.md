# Credit Card Customer Analysis (Excel-Based Project)

This project is an end-to-end **Excel-based customer analytics solution** designed to analyze credit card customer behavior, revenue distribution, and strategic growth opportunities.

The analysis focuses on transforming raw transactional data into **actionable business insights** using advanced Excel techniques, dashboards, and scenario analysis.

## 📊 Project Scope

The project covers the following analytical components:

### 1. Performance Metrics
- Total Revenue
- Total Number of Customers
- Average Transaction Amount
- Average Credit Limit
- Utilization Ratio KPIs
- Conditional formatting for KPI monitoring

### 2. Top Customer Analysis
- Identification of **Top 10 highest spending customers**
- Ranking based on total transaction amount
- Visualized using horizontal bar charts

### 3. Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)
- Revenue contribution analysis of customers
- Identification of high-value customer groups
- Cumulative revenue calculations
- Insight into revenue concentration and distribution

### 4. Customer Segmentation
Customers are segmented based on:
- Income Group
- Age Group
- Credit Limit Segment
- Transaction Frequency
- Tenure Group

Each segment is analyzed using pivot tables and visual summaries to identify strategic focus areas.

### 5. Scenario & What-If Analysis
- Goal Seek analysis for revenue growth targets
- Manual Solver logic for revenue maximization
- Scenario matrices simulating:
  - Transaction volume changes
  - Average transaction value changes
- Business interpretation of optimistic and conservative scenarios

### 6. Management Dashboard
- Single-page executive dashboard
- Dynamic KPIs connected to analysis outputs
- Clear visual storytelling for decision-makers
- Designed for non-technical users

### 7. Macro Automation Design (Conceptual)
Due to technical limitations of Excel Mac versions, classic VBA macro recording was not fully supported.

Instead, a **macro logic simulation** was designed:
- One-click data refresh logic
- Automated dashboard updates via dynamic references
- Structured process flow equivalent to macro-based automation
